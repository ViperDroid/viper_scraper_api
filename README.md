# Viper Scraper GUI üêç‚ú®

A graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and CustomTkinter designed for [**‚ö†Ô∏è Describe the specific scraping task here - e.g., extracting subdomains from a specific source, automating web data collection, finding specific online resources, etc.**]. Viper Scraper aims to provide a user-friendly way to perform these scraping tasks without needing complex command-line interactions.

It can also be easily packaged into a standalone executable for distribution.



## üöÄ Features

*   ‚úÖ **Graphical User Interface:** Easy-to-use interface built with CustomTkinter for a modern look and feel.
*   ‚úÖ **Input Flexibility:** Allows users to input [**‚ö†Ô∏è Specify what users input - e.g., target domains, keywords, API keys, file paths?**].
*   ‚úÖ **Scraping Control:** Buttons to easily Start / Stop the scraping process.
*   ‚úÖ **Real-time Feedback:** [**‚ö†Ô∏è Describe how results/status are shown - e.g., Displays results in a text box, shows a progress bar, logs messages?**].
*   ‚úÖ **Data Output:** Option to [**‚ö†Ô∏è Specify how data is saved - e.g., save scraped data to a CSV file, JSON file, copy to clipboard?**].
*   ‚úÖ **Standalone Executable:** Can be packaged into a single `.exe` file using PyInstaller for easy distribution on Windows (requires building on Windows).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the script from source, you'll need:

*   Python 3.x
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   The libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. Key requirements include:
    *   `customtkinter`
    *   [**‚ö†Ô∏è List any other major libraries your scraper uses - e.g., `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, etc.**]

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (from Source)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ViperDroid/viper_scraper_api.git
    cd viper_scraper_api
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create venv
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate venv (Linux/macOS)
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Or on Windows CMD
    # venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    # Or on Windows PowerShell
    # venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file! If not, create one from your activated venv: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python viper_scraper_exe.py
    ```
3.  The GUI application window should appear.
4.  [**‚ö†Ô∏è Add brief instructions on how to use the GUI - e.g., Enter the target domain in the input field, click 'Start', view results in the text area, click 'Save' to export.**]

## üì¶ Building the Executable

You can create a standalone executable using PyInstaller. **Note:** To create a Windows `.exe`, you must run PyInstaller on a Windows machine.

1.  Make sure you are in the activated virtual environment where you installed the requirements (`pip install pyinstaller` if you haven't already).
2.  Run PyInstaller:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed viper_scraper_exe.py
    ```
    *   `--onefile`: Bundles everything into a single executable.
    *   `--windowed`: Prevents a console window from appearing behind your GUI (use `--console` or omit if it's *meant* to be a console app).

3.  The executable will be found in the `dist` directory.
